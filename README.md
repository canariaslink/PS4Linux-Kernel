# ps4-linux
ps4-sources 5.3.7 + Bikal patches(should work for most PS4 versions)

In short this is the combination of https://github.com/ps4gentoo/ps4-linux and https://github.com/Ps3itaTeam/ps4-linux/tree/ps4-4.14.93-baikal. 
It works phenomenally well on my PS4. I use psxita v2 with this kernel. Unfortunately I haven't tested on other versions since i only own a 2115b, 
but as far as i could tell from the patches it should work on ALL* versions now. You are more than welcome to confirm this by creating an issue 
with the model and behavior.

Compiled Kernel + initramfs at: https://mega.nz/#!0XRxASjT!5dONWyNmb0n_3gEzw3OGzEbHPUVwZF3nl1sHiWPxfOw

Enjoy!
